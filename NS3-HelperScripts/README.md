# ns3 Shared Resource by Adil Alsuhaim
This `git` repository contains `ns3` resources that I share publicly. The content is as follows:

1. **CheatSheet** A PDF document containing tips & tricks to use in `ns3`
2. **examples** `ns3` program examples.
3. **ns3helpers** Scripts written in `Python` that makes running & debugging `ns3` programs easier.

## CheatSheet
I created a PDF document in `LaTeX` that contains tips & tricks on using `ns3`. I discuss many `ns3` topics including TraceSource, Attributes, creating modules and using packet tags. 

## `ns3` Examples
Under the `examples` directory we have `ns3` project directories that you can run by copying them to your `ns3`'s scratch directory. The examples were designed for `ns-3.30.1`

## NS3 Helper Scripts
* You can find scripts I use to help me run my `ns3` simulations in the directory `ns3helpers`

* There's a `README.md` under that directory with information on how to use the scripts.
